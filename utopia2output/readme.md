# Mindaffect : Utopia2output

A *utopia* system has 5 main components, namely; RECOGNISER, PRESENTATION, EEG, CONTROL and OUTPUT.  The output component is responsible for monitoring selections generated by the RECOGNISER and *when they are sufficiently confident* initiating the correct action, e.g. pressing an on-screen button, or opening a door.  This directory contains an example OUTPUT module written in java which simply logs to screen when an output would have taken place.
